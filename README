propagator_particle (propagator for trajectory simulations in zeeman experiment)

This code provides a framework for performing molecular dynamics simulations particles of known
mass and magnetic moment through the zeeman decelerator in use in Oxford. Experimental geometry 
is fairly hard coded, and makes it hard to adapt this to other experiments.

There are two parts to the programme, one written in Python for high-level preparation and interfacing
and a c-library for fast propagation. The python script provides the class *ZeemanFlyer* to facilitate 
use from external scripts, but can also be used as a standalone programme. Experimental parameters
are set in a configuration file, 'config.info', and all results are stored in the folder in which this 
configuration file is located.

##Â Compiling

instantiating the Python class *ZeemanFlyer* should automatically recompile the c library if necessary. 
This requires the gnu compiler suit to be installed, and the gnu c compiler to be accessible in the path 
as gcc. So far this has only been tested on Linux.
